CardView and RecyclerView Feeds
First launch Activity is just demo of Swipe card.On swipe right you can follow all the feeds of author of that card and on left you can skip card.But in this its just a demo.
Second Activity is the recycler view feed page where you will get all the feeds from the json file (which is already internally stored).On following a feed you will be automatically subscribed to all the feeds of that author and follow button will be removed from all those respective feeds.
On Image click will redirect to that feed detail Web view page.
